Number Guessing Game 🎯

The Number Guessing Game is a fun and interactive Python program where the user tries to guess a randomly generated number between 1 and 100. The program provides hints to guide the user, indicating whether their guess is too high or too low. The game continues until the correct number is guessed, and it displays the number of attempts taken.
